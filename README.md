<b>The City of Clouds</b> is an <b>OpenGL</b> project. I have developed this as my course project for the <b>Computer Graphics Lab(CSE422)</b> course. In this project, I have drawn one of the city views of our country. The drawing contains buildings, electric lines, sun, clouds and a bicycle just like a typical view of a city, we see everyday.
<br><br>
I have added motion in this drawing with keyword functionality. The motion effect has been assigned to the clouds. Initially, after running the code, they are not visible. If we press <b>c</b> or <b>C</b>, the clouds will start floating.
<br><br>
I have used circles and rectangles as base figures to draw the whole scenario. And for drawing circles, I have used <b>Mid Point Circle Drawing Algorithm</b>.

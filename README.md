**The City of Clouds** is an OpenGL project. I have developed this as my course project of Computer Graphics(CSE421) course. In this project, I have drawn a city place of our country. The drawing contains buildings, electric pillars, electric lines, bicycle, sun, clouds just like a typical view of city, we see everyday.<br>
<br>
I have added motion in this drawing with keyword functionality. The motion effeect has been assigned to the clouds. Initially, after running the code, they are not visible. If we press 'c' or 'C', the clouds will start floating.<br>
<br>
I have used circles and rectangles as base figures to draw this scenario. And for drawing the circle, I have used **Mid Point Circle Drawing Algorithm**.
